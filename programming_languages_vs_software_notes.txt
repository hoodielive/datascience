R and Python is the most popular tools 

- both can manipulate data 
- suitable for mathematical and statistical computations 
- they are adaptable 

not able to address to problems specific to some domains:
  i.e. SQL 
   created for working with relational database management systems (because it was specifically created when working
       with traditional historical data is where it is more advantageous)

Matlab 
- ideal for mathematical functions or matrix manipulations 
- paid language 

Big Data 
- Java/Scala 
very useful when combining data from multiple sources 

Machine Learning 
Javascript
C++ 
Scala 
Java 
Python 
R 

Software Solutions 
- smaller scope 
- a lot easier to learn 

i.e. Excel and SPSS 
Hadoop (collection of programs - software framework)
MongoDB
Apache Hbase 
SAS 
PowerBI
tableau 
Qlik
