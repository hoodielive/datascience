What is at the core of machine learing (ml)
  1. Creating an algorithm, which a computer then uses to find a model that fits the data as best as possible
  2. And makes very accurate predictions based on that
  

  ML algorithm
  - a trial-and-error process [each consecutive trial is at least as good as the previous one]

  Data -> Model -> Objective Function - Optimization Algorthim 

  - train the Model
  - Obj Func: minimized
  - Optimization Algorithm: has done its job

Benefit - the robot can learn to fire more effectively than a human!
Use - improve complex computational models (business)

  3 Types of ML
    1. Supervised Learning -> training an algorithm resembles a teacher supervising her students
       Labelled data (associating or labelling a target to a type of arrow)
       we know the target prior to the shot
       we can associate that shot with a target
       objective function -> to measure the inaccuracy 
       optimization algorithm -> to improve the way the robot shoots
    2. Unsupervised Learning -> look for a model that divides arrows in a certain way
    3. Reinforcement Learning -> every time it fires better - its rewarded re|warded in|ward in|no|cent

  Model - highly complex mathematical formula 
  Arrows - a data set
  Target - various and quantifiable goals 

  Types of Supervised Learning 
  SVMs - support vector machines 
  NNs - neural networks 
  Deep learning (new, revolutionary approach, fundamentally different from other approaches and broad pratical scope
      of application in that it is extremely accurate)
  random forests
  bayesian networks 

  UnSupervised Learning 
  k-means (mostly used)
  deep learning 

  Reinforcement Learning
  similiar to supervised learning, but instead of minimizing the loss one maximizes reward

  Machine Learning Use Cases:
  Bank Fraud [fraud detection] - [supervised learning, discerning anomalies and funny transactions are flagged]
  Client Retention - [supervised learning of customer trends, find mostly loyal customers and award them discounts]
