Predictive Analytics:
  assess potential future scenarios (outcomes) by using advanced stastical methods (Traditional Methods)
  utilize AI to predict behavior in unpredecented ways (Machine Learning) -> better for BIG Data 


Techniques for Working with Traditional Data:
Data Collection
  raw data/facts or primary data - has to be processed and converted into meaningful information 

  Data          => raw facts, processed data or information 
  raw data      => cannot be analyzed straight away 
  raw facts     => is untouched data you have accumulated and stored on the server 
  primary data  => data collection (first step)
                   surveys, cookies, etc

  raw data -> processing -> information 

  data pre-processing, a group of operations that convert raw data into a format that is more understandable 
  
  class labeling - arranging by category or (numerical)
    numerical -> number of goods sold -> 9,365 units [data like this can be manipulated]
    categorical -> New York, USA [!can be manipulated] 
  
  data cleansing -> deal with inconsistent data (misspelled words, inaccurate information, missing values)

  Specificity:
    Balancing -> ascertain who or percentage of | data-shuffling [prevents unwanted patterns, improves predictive performance]

  Entity-relationship diagram (ER diagram)
  Relational Schema [distinct data-table]


Traditional - Basic Customer Data - know the difference between categorical and numerical data
Text Data Mining 

Data Masking, conceals the original data with random and false data | conduct analysis | keep all confidential info in a secure place

FaceBook
- photos
- messages
- names
- ids
- voice records

Financial trading data 
- record the stock price every second 

information -> BI (business intelligence BI analysis) :: Job of a Business Analyst 
data skills + business knowledge + intuition 
explain past performance 

What happened? 
When did it happen?
How many units did we sell? 
In which region did we sell the most goods? 

How did our email marketing perform last quarter in terms of click-through rates and revenue generated? 
And how does that compare to the performance in the same quarter of last year? (observations)
  Observe:
    => sales volume
    => new customers 
    => monthly revenues
    => customers 

    Quantification, represent observations as numbers 
   Metrics - aims at gauging business performance or progress 
   Measure - related to a simple descriptive statistics of past performance 
   Metric = measure + business meaning 

   KPIs - Key Performance Indictors (KPIs)
   you can extract all possible metrics from a dataset, but this is both cumbersone and not necessary,
   you should select key peformance items that make sense in the context of your interest and business 
   -> KPIs = metrics + business objectives 

   Key because they are related to your main business goals 
   Performance  because of how successfully they have performed within an alloted timeframe
   Indicators because they are generated only from users who have clicked on a link provided in your ad campaign
  
   Metric
   - the traffic of a page from a website that was visited by any type of user 

   KPI
   - the traffic generated only from users who have clicked on a link provided in your ad campaign

   General Managers want BI Reports and Dashboards [lol]

  Price Optimization (hotel sites - make things attractive)
  Inventory Management (seasons)

After you have created BI graphs and shiii.. you want to pipe that info into ML to prophesy movements 

Regression - a model used for quantifying casual relationships among different variables included in your analysis

y=bx 
if y = house price and b represents a coefficent which is multiplied by x (the house size)

Define >
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression (non linear) - the values on the vertical line will be 1s and 0s only 
Cluster Analysis 
Factors 
y = a + b1 x1 + b2x2 +b3x3 +... + bnxn
x: explanatory variable (regressors, idependent variable, predictor variable)

Factor Analysis 

Time Series -> Development of values over time (sales volume) - plotting values against time since time is always
on a horizontal line seeing that its independent of any other variable (in this dimension lol)
